  # Logo Generator
  

## Description
  
My goal for this project was to create a simple command line tool to create scalable logos for m projects.  Using this program I can now create quick logos I can apply to my projects that makes them  more memmorable.

## Installation
  
To install this application start by downloading the files from the Github repository.  Next you are going to open the repository folder in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  Once open right click anywhere in the folder and select open in integrated terminal.  This will open a terminal in Vscode.  Once the terminal is open type "npm i".  This will read the package JSON and install all required packages.  Now using the terminal input the command "node index.js", this will start the application.
